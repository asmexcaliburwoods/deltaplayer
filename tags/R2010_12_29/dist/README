dplayer - a directory player, Copyright (C) Tobias Winterhalter, Germany

dplayer is a simple music file player written in Java. Instead of using a
sophisticated play list management or “my music” repository, it offers a simple
file system browser to let you choose directories containing music files. This
approach is very flexible and straight forward. No installation required and
nothing is written to the file system (except a simple properties file).

dplayer is strongly inspired by the 1by1 player of Martin Pesch. The only reason
to write an alternative to his player is the platform portability of Java. In
other words: I wanted something like 1by1 on Linux.

dplayer is just acting as front-end to command line music file players.
Currently it uses mplayer for music play-back. Theoretically, dplayer can be
used on all platforms supported by mplayer like Linux and Windows (these two are
tested).

FEATURES
========
- I18N: currently available in English, French and German language
- supported music files: mp3, ogg, wav, … (theoretically all files that can be
  played by mplayer)
- display tag info if available (id3, …)
- play, pause and position within track
- skip tracks; this information is persistent between dplayer sessions
- repeat one or all tracks
- shuffle tracks
- reduce application to icon within system tray including play-back control via
  pop-up menu

New since release 07.07

- shipped with native executable (Win only)
- show cover as background (if available)
- if dplayer is called with directory or file as argument, start immediate
  play-back

New since release 08.03

- new native installer (Win only)
- new language: French
- Settings dialog: almost all settings can be controlled by the new dialog
- search path for covers: dplayer can search in several folders for album covers
- only one dplayer instance allowed: if dpalyer is called with a music file as
  argument while another dplayer is already running, the running dplayer will
  switch to the specified file and the second dplayer will terminate immediately
- multi-threaded: dpalyer will scan for music files in the background; this
  makes the GUI more responsive to user input, especially when dealing with
  larger music collections


REQUIREMENTS
============
- Windows or Linux operating system with Java Runtime Environment
- Java Runtime Environment >= 1.5.0
- working mplayer installation (s. http://www.mplayerhq.hu/)
  mplayer is available for various Linux and Windows operating systems
- ca. 4MB hard disk space


INSTALLATION
============
dplayer comes as a simple zip file containing all necessary libraries. When
downloading the binary distribution, you may choose between zip files for Linux
and Windows platforms. Create a new directory, e.g. c:\Program Files\dplayer
and un-zip the dplayer distribution file into it. That's it!

Since dplayer version 08.03 you may also download an installer for Windows. The
installer will create the directory of your choice and optionally create
shortcuts in your start menu and on your desktop.

If you meet the requirements mentioned above and the java and mplayer
executables can be found in your environment PATH, you should be able to use
mplayer without further modifications. On Windows, simply start dpalyer.exe to
give it a try! On Linux, set permissions to execute the dplayer launch script
(chmod a+x dplayer) and start it with ./dplayer.

If mplayer isn't in your search path open the Settings dialog and locate the
mplayer executable in the programs tab.


UNINSTALLATION
==============
For the time being no uninstaller is provided. Simply delete the directory under
which you installed dplayer. dplayer does not change your system in any way
(registry entries, …). If you chose to create shortcuts in your start menu or on
your desktop simply delete them too.
