This is an unordered and not weighted list of functions I want to add in the near future.

If you wish to see another feature on this list, don't hesitate to send a mail to dplayer@wcondev.de.

track table
- allow selection of multiple tracks, e.g. for skipping

folder tree
- allow selection of multiple folders, e.g. for flat display

misc
- album covers.
  also, i saw that entagger-tag-editor code contains fetcher for Amazon
  album covers. We could grab that code eventually. Caching it in the
  user-specified dir (for joxy, it would always be
  ./!META/cover.jpg/gif/png, for other users, it would be ./cover.*)
- check for full featured keyboard control
- use special keys
- allow only one instance to run
  - second instance could communicate file arguments to first instance
- favorites
  - popup menu item in directory tree to define (incl. flat if directory has subs)
  - popup menu item in favorites tree to remove favorite
  - favorites tree replaces directory tree
  - tool items to switch between directory and favorites tree
- specials (only available if song cache is enabled
  - tree with special "directories":
  	- most played, least played
  	- frequent played, long forgotten (last played long ago)
  	- recently added, timeline (ordered in years and months of adding)
  	- grouped by genre
  	- grouped by year (of album)
  - tool items to switch between directory, favorites and specials tree
  
settings dialog
- search external applications (player, mixer, ...)
- choose columns of track table
- misc behaviour: show cover, hide while minimized, ...
