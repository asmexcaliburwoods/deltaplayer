deltaplayer is a simple music file player written in Java. Instead of using a sophisticated play list management or "my music" repository, it simply offers a file system browser to let you choose directories containing music files. This approach is very flexible and straight forward. No installation required and nothing is written to the file system (except a simple properties file).

deltaplayer is strongly inspired by the '1by1' player of Martin Pesch (http://mpesch3.de1.cc/). The only reason to write an alternative to his player is the platform portability of Java. In other words: I wanted something like 1by1 on Linux.

deltaplayer is just acting as front-end to command line music file players. Currently it uses 'mplayer' for music playback. Theoretically, deltaplayer can be used on all platforms supported by mplayer like Linux and Windows (these two are tested).
